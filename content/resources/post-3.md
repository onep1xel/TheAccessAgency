## We’ve all done it - made up an excuse or convinced ourselves of a reason not to go out. Maybe it was a colleague’s party, a drink with old schoolmates or coffee with Aunt Mavis. And maybe you’ve come up with creative reasons – telling yourself ‘it might rain’, ‘they won’t notice if I skip it’, and the perennial classic - ‘I’ll go next time’.

It’s a habit worth breaking. For one; memorable experiences don’t just knock at your front door – you have to make them happen. But more than that, getting out can encourage other people to venture out too. And this can only be good.
Being visible in our communities - in shops, cafes, at the post office, anywhere – does more for disability awareness than you might think. It’s definitely more powerful than liking a social media post.

Exploring what’s on offer in your home town is a great way to get a taste of travel and build your confidence. Local micro-travels can lead to day trips which can lead to international voyages. Hitting the streets is less stressful and more rewarding than ever with accessibility becoming better every day.

Think about how you can stay connected, explore new places and share stories. With a bit of preparation, a spirit of adventure and a friend or two you might break a rut and discover a new lust for life – or at least a decent place for a flat white.

So, how to make the next-time you leave your place a wild success - gliding along flat, fresh concrete, rolling effortlessly into a cafe that’s generous on space and smiles?

Here are a few of my tips.

### Be organised
There are great resources out there for accessible information. Ask a friend or the disabled community for recommendations - Facebook, blogs and websites are great for this – look for listings or sites with photos so you get an idea of what to expect. Phone ahead – ask questions or even ask staff to send photos. Ask for their name too – you can thank them in person. Google Street View offers a way to see the streetscape (the date of the image is on the bottom right). Public transport accessibility is changing constantly, take a look online for the latest upgrades. Car park information can be found online too (The City of Melbourne has a map showing all the disabled carparks in and around the CDB). Planning can build anticipation and excitement – try to enjoy it.

### Take your time
Nothing sours a night out like rushing to get ready. Same with feeling like you’ve forgotten to do something. Don’t stress yourself out – arrange enough time to cover off what you need to. Have a shower, have a cup of tea, feed your gold goldfish and water your plants. Arrange someone to help. Give yourself time to think about the trip in a positive light – to get comfortable with the idea.

### Be open
No-one is guaranteed a great time every time they leave the house. To get good odds on a great time out - be realistic. Stuff happens. Bringing a sense of adventure and a sense of humour. Travel – up the street or around the world – is most rewarding when you open your arms to unexpected experiences. Things can turn from bad to good with a positive attitude and a sense of perspective.
