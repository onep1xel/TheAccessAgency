    **This is first column**

    The tricky thing is, the terrain can be a barrier and most people don’t know what to expect when they visit.
    *What’s there? How’s the surface? Are there allocated accessible car parks and toilets?*

    [**Parks Victoria**](https://www.parks.vic.gov.au/ "Parks Victoria website") engaged us to research, write, edit and produce videos for 10 selected parks –showcasing the access for mobility.

    We worked with John Kenwright in the Parks Victoria Access and Inclusion team and Nick Esser in Marketing - along with staff and rangers - to understand the history, biodiversity and uniqueness of each park.

    After inviting family and our friends from the disabled community - we got to filming. Across a 6-month period dodging COVID lockdowns we shot at these wonderful public parks – some of them iconic Victorian destinations in their own right. We provided planning, talent, voice-over, camera work, motion graphics, edits and final output
