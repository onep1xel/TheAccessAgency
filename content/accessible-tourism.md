    The [UNWTO](https://www.unwto.org/accessibility "United Nations World Tourism Organization") call it a [**‘exceptional business opportunity’**](https://www.unwto.org/accessibility "UNWTO Accessible Tourism Page"), the EU say it will [**‘boost competitiveness’**](https://single-market-economy.ec.europa.eu/sectors/tourism/offer/accessible-tourism_en "EU Enhancing Tourism") and Tourism Australia feature it heavily in their [**‘Future of Demand’**](https://www.tourism.australia.com/en/insights/consumer-research/future-of-demand.html "Tourism Australia, Future of Demand Report") report.
    Over in the UK, they’re on a mission to become [‘the most accessible destination in Europe by 2025’](https://www.visitbritain.org/tourism-sector-deal "Visit Britain, Tourism Sector Deal")‘.

    **So what’s all the excitement about?**

    Accessible Tourism is broadly the notion of *Tourism For All* or *Tourism Without Barriers*. The principle is that tourism services and products should be open to everyone.
    In terms of access – yes that means ramps, toilets and parking. But it also means providing accessible information so people can make informed decisions.
    Inclusive tourism means enabling a holistic, universal customer experience, a philosophy of operating that welcomes everyone.

    ## What does it mean for organisations?

    In everyday terms, it's about improving the visitor experience both online and in-person -
    recognising and respecting difference, removing barriers and enhancing independence and dignity.   

    For operators big and small, this may mean –

    - Looking at the existing physical environment to reduce barriers
    - Reviewing printed materials and digital resources so access information is provided
    - Ensuring visitor materials are provided in an accessible format
    - Investing in quick access wins (like providing a clear path of travel)
    - Ensuring planned, new developments are accessible
    - Providing employees with the confidence to engage with different and disabled visitors
    - Marketing accessibility and inclusivity as a significant visitor benefit

    To find out more, you can see a video from our presentation on [Marketing Accessibility](/resources).

    We’ve got some great reading in our [resources section](/resources).

  - title: It’s only for people in wheelchairs
    content: |-
        Most disabilities are invisible.

        And most mobility problems don’t involve wheelchairs.\
        \
        Barriers that stop visitors enjoying themselves are varied.
        They can be a result of frailty, low-vision, concentration, strength, hearing-loss, even mood.

        \
        Beach matting was originally rolled out for wheelchair users, now everyone uses it as a way to get onto the beach. Accessibility features usually come to benefit everyone.

  - title: People with disabilities don’t spend
    content: |-
      People with disabilities (PwDs) account for more than 11% of revenue in the travel sector  [*(Source: Tourism Research Australia )*](https://www.tra.gov.au/Archive-TRA-Old-site/Research/View-all-publications/All-Publications/Destination-Visitor-Survey-results/Strategic-regional-research-reports/accessible-tourism-victoria-queensland).

      \
      This is predicted to reach 25% in coming years. Twenty-five percent.

  - title: It’s too difficult & expensive
    content: |-
      In many cases there isn’t an accessibility problem, there’s an access information problem.

      \
      By providing better information, a more inclusive customer experience and some access adjustments, destinations can make customers with disabilities feel welcomed and valued.

      \
      Also, when you do invest in physical spaces, every dollar spent returns $30 when investing in Universal Design [*(Source: City Of Melboune)*](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwji6Znh9v37AhUvsVYBHajfDBsQFnoECBMQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.melbourne.vic.gov.au%2Fsitecollectiondocuments%2Fgood-access-good-business-infograph.doc&usg=AOvVaw2H4oZjWhTvvClDGHXf7nNt).

      **$AUD10BN per year.**
      \
      That’s the value of this segment to the Australian economy.
      People with access needs take more than 54,000 trips per year and stay longer than able-bodied travellers.
      And they’re 50% more loyal than regular customers *(Kantar Futures)*.

      \
      **The market is significant in size and growing 22% year-on-year.**

      [*(Source: Forbes Magazine & Tourism Research Australia)*](https://www.tra.gov.au/Archive-TRA-Old-site/Research/View-all-publications/All-Publications/Destination-Visitor-Survey-results/Strategic-regional-research-reports/accessible-tourism-victoria-queensland)


  - title: We can't promote accessibility because we have stairs
    content: |-
      **What’s accessible for one person may not be for another.**

      \
      And there’s certainly no such thing as 100% accessible.\
      Destinations can begin by having an audit conducted and illustrating what they have in place – allowing visitors to decide for themselves if it’s ‘accessible’.

Travel parties consist of an average 3.2 people. 3 – Once disabled travellers something they like that suits their needs, they return. They're 50% more loyal according to Kantar Futures.
