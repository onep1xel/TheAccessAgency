    The UNWTO have labelled it a [**‘great opportunity’**](https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote "UNWTO Accessible Tourism"), the EU say it’s a [**‘moral obligation’**](https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote "EU Accessible Tourism") and Tourism Australia refer to it as a [**‘Pillar of opportunity’**](https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote "EU Accessible Tourism").
    Across in the UK, England wants to be the most accessible destination in Europe by 2026.

    So, what’s all the excitement about?

    Accessible tourism broadly refers to the notion of ***Tourism For All*** or ***Tourism Without Barriers***. The principle is that tourism services and products should be open to everyone.
    In terms of access – yes that means ramps, toilets and parking. But it also means providing accessible information so people can make informed decisions.
    Inclusion means enabling a customer service, a philosophy of operating that involves everyone.

    ### Accessibility is key to the future of the visitor economy.
    A growing number of travellers with access needs - and the resources to travel - are making their way into the market.
    They want information, accessible experiences and innovative products.
    They’ve high expectations and like us – they’ve access needs but are evermore active.
    As we grow older as a society this market is growing 22% year on year[^1].
