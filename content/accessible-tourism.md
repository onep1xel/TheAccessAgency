    The UNWTO have labelled it a [**‘great opportunity’**](https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote "UNWTO Accessible Tourism"), the EU say it’s a [**‘moral obligation’**](https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote "EU Accessible Tourism") and Tourism Australia refer to it as a [**‘Pillar of opportunity’**](https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote "EU Accessible Tourism").
    Across in the UK, England wants to be the most accessible destination in Europe by 2026.

    So, what’s all the excitement about?

    Accessible Tourism is broadly the notion of ***Tourism For All*** or ***Tourism Without Barriers***. The principle is that tourism services and products should be open to everyone.
    In terms of access – yes that means ramps, toilets and parking. But it also means providing accessible information so people can make informed decisions.
    Inclusion means enabling a customer service, a philosophy of operating that involves everyone.

    ## What does it mean for operators?

    In everyday terms, it's about improving the visitor experience both online and in-person -
    recognising and respecting difference, removing barriers and enhancing independence and dignity.   

    For operators big and small, this may mean –

    - Looking at your existing physical environment to reduce barriers
    - Reviewing printed materials and digital resources so access information is provided
    - Ensuring visitor materials are provided in an accessible format
    - Investing in quick access wins (like proving a clear path of travel)
    - Ensuring planned, new developments are accessible
    - Providing employees with the confidence to engage with different and disabled visitors
    - Marketing your accessibility and inclusive approach

    To find out more, you can see a video from our presentation on [Marketing Accessibility](/resources) Marketing Access here.
    If you want to get started with a self-assessment, you can find a basic [checklist here](https://www.example.com)

    We’ve got some great reading in our [resources section](https://www.example.com).
