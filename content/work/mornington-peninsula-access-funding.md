    #### Challenge

    How does a Tourism organisation talk about access and inclusion at an event in a way that is authentic, energised and broad reaching? They commission someone with a disability to cover it.

    #### Process

    Visit Victoria/Visit Melbourne contacted The Access Agency to cover AbilityFest for their social media. AbilityFest - organised by the Dylan Alcott Foundation and untitled group – is Australia’s first and only completely accessible outdoor festival music festival. Ryan spoke with Dylan, volunteers and attendees at the festival conveying the excitement, scale and philosophy of the Event.

    #### Result

    A video sequence was edited down to 14 stories that captured the day – from anticipation, to the practical accessibility through to the late night climax and fireworks. The piece also showcased other live music options throughout Melbourne – providing options all year round for those with access needs.
