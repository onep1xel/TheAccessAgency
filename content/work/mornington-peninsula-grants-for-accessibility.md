    Mornington Peninsula Shire believes strongly in access and inclusion. Virginia Richardson, heading up the area, is a long-time advocate, Universal Design professional and champion of inclusion. The council grants were available for business to improve their access – physical and virtual – but how to get word out? And what does accessibility mean to local traders?

    The Access Agency worked with the Mornington Peninsula Shire Disability Advisory Committee (DAC), ‘MP Business’ members and local council to see what messaging would cut through to encourage submissions.
    We needed to tap into a trader/operator mindset to see what resonated. Several sessions were held with the DAC and Council until the script for an explanatory video was developed.
    The video was accompanied by three access checklists – created by Virginia - to
    enable businesses to self-assess.

    The video was shared on social media, and through digital channels – leading to the checklists and to the grant applications.
    Not only did the community of businesses respond to the funding opportunities, they also developed an understanding of how access can help business efforts in the future.
