    **In August 2023, The Access Agency and [**Inclusive Tourism Australia**](http://www.inclusivetourism.com.au "Inclusive Tourism Australia") teamed up to develop and deliver the [***Gold Coast Accessible Visitor Guide***](https://www.goldcoast.qld.gov.au/Services/Supporting-our-community/People-with-disability/Accessible-Visitor-Guide "Gold Coast Accessible Visitor Guide") to promote the Gold Coast as an accessible destination.**

    The work, commissioned by Destination Gold Coast and the Gold Coast City Council is a first-of-its-kind resource for travellers with access needs as part of **The Year of Accessible Tourism**.

    Comprehensive assessment criterion and tailored checklists were developed, underpinned by Australian Standards and Universal Design principles. More than 30 site audits were conducted at accommodation providers and 7 attractions were undertaken to determine the level of accessibility offered. Photography of key elements was captured, and this visitor-focussed data was used to populate the Guide. Access Statements were developed for the attractions to incorporate into their websites.

    The Guide includes information on Accommodation options ranging from budget to luxury, Attractions, Transport options, including Airport, buses, ferry, taxis and rideshare; and Council resources including mobility maps and locations of beach wheelchairs and matting.
    The Gold Coast Accessible Visitor Guide has a level of detail not seen in visitor assets before, showcasing information on the access elements crucial to people with access needs, enabling them to plan and book their holidays with confidence.
