    We were excited to be asked to present about Accessible Tourism at [**Visit Victoria's**](https://corporate.visitvictoria.com "Visit Victoria corporate website") **‘Marketing Excellence’ program**.

    The 4-day workshop for best-in-class operators culminated in an afternoon of presentations about hot opportunities in selected areas – spotlighting First Nations, Sustainability and Accessibility. Ryan spoke about myths, visitor types, revenue opportunities, and legal obligations – followed up by international and local examples and simple steps to getting started.

    The two sessions in 2022 were well attended, and a chance to learn about marketing from the state’s peak body.

    ### Why is internal capacity and confidence building the starting point?

    Disability in tourism can be a messy topic – it crosses through customer experience, human rights, revenue, building codes, health and safety, human resources, and marketing.

    Which is why the best place to start is with internal training and awareness.
    Not a dull, mountain of slides but real-life experiences shared to illustrate key factors.
    Our presentations are delivered by a person with a disability who understands how to make the complex simple and provide valuable tools and insights to take away.
