    #### Overview

    We were honoured to be engaged by Visit Victoria to talk about accessible tourism as part of their Marketing Excellence program, a 4-day workshop for best-in-class operators.

    Designed to identify outstanding product offerings in Victoria – the program ensures operators have the tools and capability to excel in their communication to consumers. The goal is to empower them to deliver an exceptional experience throughout the visitor’s journey with them.

    Ryan spoke at the two sessions in 2022 – sharing insights, impact and getting started in accessible and inclusive tourism. Statistics, revenue and obligations were followed up by international and local examples and getting started in the practise.

    ### Why is internal capacity and confidence building the starting point?

    Disability in tourism can be a messy topic – it crosses through customer experience, human rights, revenue, building codes, health and safety, human resources, and marketing.

    Which is why the best place to start is with internal training and awareness.
    Not a dull, mountain of slides but real-life experiences shared to illustrate key factors.
    Our presentations are delivered by a person with a disability who understands how to make the complex simple and provide valuable tools and insights to take away.
