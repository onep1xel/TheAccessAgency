    For three years we have presented on Accessible Tourism at [**Visit Victoria's**](https://corporate.visitvictoria.com "Visit Victoria corporate website") ***International Ready*** and ***Marketing Excellence*** programs.

    The intensive programs are for best-in-class operators to expand, improve and excel in their tourism product development. The final day culminates in an afternoon of presentations about  opportunities in selected areas – spotlighting First Nations, Sustainability and Accessibility.

    Ryan spoke about a wide range of topics including:
    - myths about disability and travel
    - how PwD (people with disabilities) and groups plan their travel
    - statistics and revenue opportunities
    - technology and innovation in assistive devices for travel
    - legal obligations for tourism operators in Australia
    - how and where to start
    - what information to provide (and how to provide it)
    - how to measure effectiveness  

    We are incredibly proud to be engaged on these valuable programs; they help businesses  prepare to take the next step in their product development journey, reaching new markets and telling their inclusion story their way.

    Kudos @VisitVictoria.

    ### Why is internal capacity and confidence the starting point?

    Disability in tourism can be a messy topic – it crosses through customer experience, human rights, revenue, building codes, health and safety, human resources, and marketing.

    Which is why the best place to start is with internal training and awareness.
    Not a dull, mountain of slides but real-life experiences shared to illustrate key factors.
    Our presentations are delivered by a person with a disability who understands how to make the complex simple and provide valuable tools and insights to take away.
