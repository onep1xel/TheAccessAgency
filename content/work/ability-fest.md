    #### Challenge

    Ability Fest, organised by the Dylan Alcott Foundation and Untitled Group, is Australia’s only fully accessible and inclusive music festival. The 2021 event was held in Melbourne’s Alexandra Gardens with top-notch acts like Alex the Astronaut, Illy, Pecking Duck, What So Not and Confidence Man.
    The unique event featured Auslan interpreters, a Marveloo Changing Places toilet, accessible toilets, ramps and matting throughout, a sensory chill zone, Bindi Maps beacon navigation, elevated viewing platforms, dog guide relief and water bowls, quiet areas and lots more.

    Ryan interviewed attendees, organisers, volunteers and Dylan himself about the vision and purpose of the day. Given ‘Access All Areas’ the goal was to show slices of the event as the day rolled on. Ryan filmed and edited the video highlights and patched them across to Visit Victoria for release. He also looked at other accessible music venues across the city too – for year-round entertainment in our dynamic city.

    The video series was viewed by local and international audiences – showcasing Melbourne as a safe inclusive and accessible city – reinforcing our liveable city credentials.
