    The last few years have played havoc with the visitation of Australia’s large cities. Lockdowns have seen residents steer-clear and visitor numbers plummet.

    The [City of Melbourne](https://melbourne.vic.gov.au) (CoM), through their magazine [***What’s on Melbourne***](https://whatson.melbourne.vic.gov.au) has pushed forward with activation programs, large-scale events and continual messaging through digital channels – drawing people back into the heart of our city.

    We approached City of Melbourne with the aim of showcasing accessible experiences for visitors with access needs. **Approximately 25% of national and international visitors to the CBD are aged 55 years and over[^1]** and showcasing accessible dining options to customers of all stripes is a good idea.

    After some reconosence trips to review access The Access Agency, planned the shoot, storyboarding key elements, sourced talent and wrote the script for the video that showcased the multitude of accessible dining on offer.

    We worked with a talented team that included the CoM Team at [***What’s on Melbourne***](https://whatson.melbourne.vic.gov.au) and their oft used video and photo team. Plus the lovely people with disabilities (* and without) in front of the screen Jay Knight, Emily Dove and Maya Dove.

    ### Why use social media to talk about access?
