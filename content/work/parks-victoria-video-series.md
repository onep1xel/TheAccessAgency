    #### Challenge

    Parks Victoria wanted to showcase the ‘all abilities access’ of 10 selected parks. Scattered around the state and not all strictly ‘accessible’, each have their own appeal.

    #### Process

    We worked closely with Parks staff and with members of the disability community to write, shoot and produce the videos in a way that showcased access while providing the genuine excitement in visiting these beautiful places.

    #### Result

    The first video was released on ‘International Wheelchair Day’ in March 2021 and within three days had reached 2,000+ people.
    Three months later it had reached 10K views. Moreover, the first video was shared widely between friends, family and people with reduced mobility - those who benefit the most are getting the information they need to plan and visit parks with confidence.
