    **Parks should be for everyone. They’re calming, regenerative and should be easy for everyone to visit.**

    The tricky thing is, the terrain can be a barrier and most people don’t know what to expect when they visit.
    *What’s there? How’s the surface? Are there allocated accessible car parks and toilets?*

    [**Parks Victoria**](https://www.parks.vic.gov.au/ "Parks Victoria website") engaged us to research, write, edit and produce videos for 10 selected parks –showcasing the access for mobility.

    We worked with John Kenwright in the Parks Victoria Access and Inclusion team and Nick Esser in Marketing - along with staff and rangers - to understand the history, biodiversity and uniqueness of each park.

    After inviting family and our friends from the disabled community - we got to filming. Across a 6-month period dodging COVID lockdowns we shot at these wonderful public parks – some of them iconic Victorian destinations in their own right. We provided planning, talent, voice-over, camera work, motion graphics, edits and final output

    The first video, covering [**Tidal River at Wilsons Promontory**](https://www.parks.vic.gov.au/places-to-see/parks/wilsons-promontory-national-park/things-to-do/tidal-river-visitor-centre), was released on ‘International Wheelchair Day’ in March 2021. It showcased the accommodation options, beach access and accessible walks. Within three days more than 2,000 people had viewed the video sharing with their networks.
    Three months later it had reached over 10K views. Importantly, the video was shared widely to those who were planning to visit – proving the information was what they needed to plan and visit with confidence.

    The pilot series paved the way with plans to develop similar content showcasing other disabilities in other parks.
    This is one of our first projects and is very close to our hearts, we’d like to thank all involved – with special thanks to John Kenwright.

    ### Why show accessibility in social media?

    Facebook, Instagram, Tic-toc are all great platforms to talk about access. On one hand, that's where your audience are when they're looking to be inspired. That spark when someone decides to start shopping for travel – **for some, that can ignite by seeing good accessibility**.

    See what we did for socials during the [Ability Fest](/work/ability-fest/) event.
