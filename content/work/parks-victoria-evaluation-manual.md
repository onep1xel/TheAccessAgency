    **The Access Agency has worked with [**Parks Victoria**](https://www.parks.vic.gov.au) on a range accessibility and inclusion projects since 2018 and we're very proud of this one.**

    The Parks Victoria Evaluation Manual is a tool to help Area Park Rangers and key parks staff perform self-evaluations of their park assets.
    The document defines and illuminates a wide range of accessible elements within the outdoors - from pathways, lookouts and piers through to bathrooms, bird hides and fire pits. There are two main parts to the document; the first explains fundamental access elements, the reason they need to be considered and the recommended dimensions and installation. The second lists the criteria for self-assessment, allowing users to measure and understand how they match-up against recommendations.

    The Access Agency produced the 2024 updated version of this important document.
    As part of the project park audits were conducted and reports were produced. Each report – containing more than 60+ and up to 120+ recommendations – offers overviews and recommendations for development of world class experiences. The photos throughout illustrate barriers to access, opportunities, and methods of mitigating any risks. These reports will become the foundation of capital improvements, minor upgrades and staff awareness on access, allowing rangers to capitalise on park assets.

    The highly visited Wilsons Promontory, the iconic Albert Park Lake and the multi-faceted Point Nepean National Park are among the parks benefiting from a consolidated, comprehensive assessment that allows for an evolving accessible outdoor visitor experience.
