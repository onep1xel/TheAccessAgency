    [Ability Fest](https://www.abilityfest.com.au) is Australia’s only fully accessible and inclusive music festival.

    Ryan attended and created video packages for [Visit Melbourne](https://www.visitmelbourne.com) that were then shared with their nine hundred thousand local and international followers.

    Organised by the [Dylan Alcott Foundation](https://dylanalcottfoundation.com.au) and Untitled Group, the 2021 event was held in Melbourne’s picturesque Alexandra Gardens. The headline acts were some of Australia’s top-notch regulars like *Alex the Astronaut*, *Illy*, *Pecking Duck*, *What So Not* and *Confidence Man*.

    Ryan had ‘access all areas’ to share the view of a disabled festivalgoer. He attended with another wheelchair user, Sebastian, and his carer Michael. They arrived and got the lay of the land, checking out the food trucks, dancefloors and raised viewing areas.

    The unique event featured Auslan interpreters, a portable Changing Places toilet, matting throughout, a sensory chill zone, elevated viewing platforms and lots more.
    Ryan spliced together interviews, backstage footage and on the spot reviews and fireworks. The video wrapped up with suggestions of other accessible live music options in Melbourne.
    This video takeover showcased Ability Fest and framed Melbourne as a safe, inclusive and accessible city – reinforcing our liveable city credentials to visitors.
