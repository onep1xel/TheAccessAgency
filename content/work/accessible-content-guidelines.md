    **Sometimes you want a map or guidebook to step you though an unfamiliar or complex topic.**

    That’s the idea behind the **Accessible Communications Guidelines** we created for local government agencies (LGAs) on behalf of [*Get Skilled Access*](https://getskilledaccess.com.au/).

    Contracted as part of the [*Queensland Accessible Tourism*](https://teq.queensland.com/au/en/industry/what-we-do/cruise_indigenous_nature_tourism/accessible-tourism) project, we provided a 50-page document outlining accessibility principles and considerations in simple terms.

    We documented best practice in digital accessibility with topics including communications workflow, producing accessible articles, undertaking a video and audio content, accessible publishing and reviewing content for good access.

    The resulting guide is an invaluable resource – one tourism businesses and LGAs can use to provide material for all kinds of visitors.

    ### Providing visitor materials everyone can use.

    98% of your customers will carry out some research online before they arrange a visit. Just like physical access, when you provide information in an accessible format, all your customers benefit. Ensuring your existing and new materials are universally available means baking it into your process and aligning to best-practice. We can help.
