    Sometimes you want a map or guidebook to step you though a unfamiliar or complex topic.

    Thatâ€™s the idea behind the Accessible Communications Guidelines we created for local government agencies (LGAs) and tourism operators. Contracted by [*Get Skilled Access*](https://getskilledaccess.com) as part of their Queensland Accessible Tourism project, we explored the best practice and recommended approaches to communications.

    Topics include creating a workflow, producing accessible articles, video and audio content, accessible publishing best-practice and reviewing content for good access.

    We see the resulting 50-page document being used as a go-to guide for tourism businesses and LGAs when creating material for visitors with access needs.

    ### Providing visitor materials everyone can use.

    98% of your customers will carry out some research online before they arrange a visit. Just like physical access, when you provide information in an accessible format, all your customers benefit. Ensuring your existing and new materials are universally available means baking it into your process and aligning to best-practice. We can help.
