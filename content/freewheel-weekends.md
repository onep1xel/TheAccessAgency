        ##### The start of my trip to Berlin was a nightmare.

        Ten years ago, I was travelling in my wheelchair solo, halfway around the world to the German capital. With 3 weeks annual leave, some savings and a passion for Deutsch design culture, I was more than excited.

        The guy I was talking to about my accommodation, assured me the converted warehouse I’d seen online was suitable for my needs.
        I even sent the exact dimensions of my wheelchair.

        After 22 hours in the air and a 4-hour train trip I arrived, exhausted, to find my uber-cool Kreuzberg digs inaccessible. Apparently, it was ‘wheelchair-friendly’ after the 20 cm step at the entry.

        For the record I had a great time in Berlin, but this is not a unique story. Everyone with access needs has had similar problems.

        ### I started Freewheel Weekends to create the kind of material I look for when I’m planning travel. It’s the questions that aren’t answered by travel sites, that I feature in my reviews and videos.

        ### What are the surfaces like? Are the paths steep? Where are the accessible toilets?
