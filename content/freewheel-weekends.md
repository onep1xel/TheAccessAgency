        ### Overview & background

        Freewheel Weekends (FWW) is a vlog / guide for travellers with reduced mobility. There are video guides to The Pyramid of Giza, from Jerusalem’s Old City from New Zealand’s Bay of Islands and more.
        The Directory has listings of Melbourne’s best accessible experiences – from restaurants to museums and galleries.

        FWW started as a diary in 2017 and grew into a useful resource with first-hand guides to some great travel experiences.

        ### The start of my trip to Berlin was a nightmare.

        Ten years ago, I was travelling in my wheelchair solo, halfway around the world to the German capital. With 3 weeks annual leave, some savings and a passion for Deutsch design culture, I was more than excited.

        The guy I was talking to about my accommodation, assured me the converted warehouse I’d seen online was suitable for my needs.
        I even sent the exact dimensions of my wheelchair.

        After 22 hours in the air and a 4-hour train trip I arrived, exhausted, to find my uber-cool Kreuzberg digs inaccessible. Apparently, it was ‘wheelchair-friendly’ after the 20 cm step at the entry.

        For the record I had a great time in Berlin, but this is not a unique story. Everyone with access needs has had similar problems.

        I started Freewheel Weekends to create the kind of material I look for when I’m planning travel. It’s the questions that aren’t answered by travel sites, that I feature in my reviews and videos.

        What are the surfaces like? Are the paths steep? Where are the accessible toilets?
