        ### Overview & background

        [***Freewheel Weekends (FWW)***](https://www.freewheelweekends.com "This is Boostnote's repository") is a website, a vlog, travel guide and directory for travellers with reduced mobility. There are video guides to The Pyramid of Giza, from Jerusalem’s Old City from New Zealand’s Bay of Islands and more. There’s also first-hand accounts of trying new stuff – like indoor climbing or sled hockey.
        The Directory covers some of Melbourne’s best accessible experiences – from restaurants to museums and galleries.

        In 2017 Freewheel Weekends began when I took a year off after finishing at a large tech company. The idea started as a way of recording new experiences and grew into a magazine for people with reduced mobility. Deciding to be editorially independent and not beholden to advertisers meant self-funding but it also meant creative control.

        ### The start of my trip to Berlin was a nightmare.

        Ten years ago, I was travelling in my wheelchair solo, halfway around the world to the German capital. With 3 weeks annual leave, some savings and a passion for Deutsch design culture, I was more than excited.

        The guy I was talking to about my accommodation, assured me the converted warehouse I’d seen online was suitable for my needs.
        I even sent the exact dimensions of my wheelchair.

        After 22 hours in the air and a 4-hour train trip I arrived, exhausted, to find my uber-cool Kreuzberg digs inaccessible. Apparently, it was ‘wheelchair-friendly’ after the 20 cm step at the entry.

        For the record I had a great time in Berlin, but this is not a unique story. Everyone with access needs has had similar problems.

        I started Freewheel Weekends to create the kind of material I look for when I’m planning travel. It’s the questions that aren’t answered by travel sites, that I feature in my reviews and videos.

        What are the surfaces like? Are the paths steep? Where are the accessible toilets?
